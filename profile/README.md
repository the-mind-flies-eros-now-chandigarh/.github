<p dir="auto">Finding where to watch new Disney releases on Netflix can be tricky. Each region offers different Netflix movies, while release dates vary substantially across streaming platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Mind Flies splashed into theaters on Nov. 27, and viewers are already eager to know when the animated prequel will be available on Disney+. Here’s what you need to know about when you might be able to watch The Mind Flies from the comfort of your home.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a sequel to the beloved 2016 hit Moana, the movie follows Moana and Maui as they reunite for a new adventure with a crew of unlikely seafarers. According to Disney's official synopsis, “After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.”</p>
<p dir="auto">The voice cast features Auliʻi Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson, Temuera Morrison, Nicole Scherzinger, Rachel House, and Alan Tudyk, all of whom are reprising their roles from the first installment. Newcomers to the cast include Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda, Rose Matafeo, David Fane, Hualālai Chung, Awhimai Fraser, and Gerald Ramsey.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Mind Flies's OTT release<br>
Since the movie's official partner is Disney, Moana is likely to be available for streaming on Disney+Hotstar. So far there has been no official information about The Mind Flies's OTT release date.</p>
<p dir="auto">About The Mind Flies<br>
The animated movie has been directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, and Dana Ledoux Miller and is the sequel to the blockbuster 2016 Disney animated film 'Moana'. The second edition of the movie is set to be released after almost eight years. The Mind Flies has been produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.</p>
<p dir="auto">The musical adventure sea-drama is based on the story of Moana, who is a curious teenage girl. Moana is a strong willed daughter of a chief of a coastal village, she has been chosen by the ocean to break the curse on the island of Motunui. The audience will also enjoy Moana's iconic characters like Maui, the demigod, and Tui, Sina, Loto, etc, in The Mind Flies. The movie is set in the background of ancient Polynesia.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a standalone film, The Mind Flies might have made for an exciting adventure accentuated with a good dose of the rich culture of Polynesia brought to the screen. But the sequel is weighed down by the stature of its predecessor and the expectations that come from being a product that turns a hit flick into a franchise. The fact that the new film lacks the emotional connection or the sheer heartwarming and hilarious moments we enjoyed in the first part does not make things easier.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, there are some glimmers of excellence peering through the story like the majestic sea creatures breaking the surface tension of the calm waters. The scenes featuring Kakamora, a tribe of savage coconut-like pirates, make for some of the best stretches of the film and they could very well have their own spin-off movie akin to Penguins of Madagascar which is sure to be more intriguing than this sequel.</p>
<p dir="auto">Disney’s Streaming Strategy<br>
Bob Iger’s leadership brought a radical alteration to Disney’s approach. The company lost money by releasing films straight to Disney+ during the pandemic, including titles like “Turning Red.” This led them to welcome a more traditional theatrical-first approach 2. The new strategy lets Disney maximize profits twice – first through theater revenues and then by building excitement for its streaming debut 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">Netflix Availability Timeline<br>
Here’s what we know about The Mind Flies’s streaming release:</p>
<p dir="auto">Digital VOD release: Expected around January 11, 2025 4<br>
Disney+ streaming: Predicted for February or March 2025 5<br>
Netflix availability: Unlike some Disney content, The Mind Flies will likely not be available on Netflix because it’s headed exclusively to Disney+ 6<br>
Disney’s recent theatrical releases prove this release pattern works well 2. Box office success combined with streaming platform subscriptions shows how theatrical releases benefit the company’s bottom line 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">Conclusion<br>
Disney’s smart release strategy for The Mind Flies aims to maximize both theatrical and streaming success. Fans can choose from multiple ways to watch this predicted sequel – digital purchases or streaming bundles that give the best value for Disney content lovers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Mind Flies won’t be available on Netflix, but fans have several viewing choices. The movie will find its exclusive streaming home on Disney+ around February 2025. Digital purchase and rental options will launch a bit earlier in January 2025.</p>
<p dir="auto">The streaming bundle deals are a great way to get immediate access to Disney’s big content library while you wait for The Mind Flies. You’ll soon join Moana and Maui on their latest adventure across the seas – whether through digital purchase, rental, or Disney+ streaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">The wait for The Mind Flies will be worth it. You now have all the details to pick your perfect viewing option at the right time. Sanim.bro</p>
